# Self-Driving-Car-Nanodegree
The Self-Driving Car Engineer is an online certification intended to prepare students to become self-driving car engineers. The program was developed by Udacity in partnership with Mercedes-Benz, NVIDIA, Otto, DiDi, BMW, McLaren and NextEv.

### Developing self driving car project


### Term 2: Sensor Fusion, Localisation and Control (Started March 2017)

### 1. Sensor Fusion
#### Project 1
In this project, a kalman filter is utilized to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. 
#### Project 2
In this project, an Unscented Kalman Filter is utilized to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. 

### 2. Localisation
#### Project 3
The robot has been kidnapped and transported to a new location! Luckily it has a map of this location, a (noisy) GPS estimate of its initial location, and lots of (noisy) sensor and control data. In this project, a 2 dimensional particle filter is implemented in C++. The particle filter will be given a map and some initial localization information (analogous to what a GPS would provide). At each time step, the filter will also get observation and control data.

### 3. Control
#### Project 4
The  proportional–integral–derivative controller is implemented to steer the car. 

#### Project 5
The Model predictive control is implemented to steer the car.
